## Features
- Fully responsive for desktop and mobile
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Circular profile image for a clean look
- Sections for About, Experience, Projects, and Contact
- Downloadable resume button
- Links to my LinkedIn and GitHub

## Tech Stack
- **HTML & CSS** for structure and styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity

## Plans for the Future

- Integrate a contact form with backend support
